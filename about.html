  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I am <strong>Parneet Kaur</strong>, the artist behind Kainth Artwork Gallery. 
    Art has been my passion since childhood, and I specialize in creating 
    <strong>mandalas, traditional Indian motifs, calligraphy, tattoo designs, and custom hand-painted artworks</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each piece I create is a blend of patience, emotion, and creativity. 
    I believe that every artwork tells a story and can bring a sense of calm, inspiration, and beauty into a home or personal space. 
    I strive to make art that is not only visually appealing but also meaningful and unique.
  </p>

  <h2>My Journey</h2>

    I started experimenting with art at a young age, exploring different styles, patterns, and techniques. 
    Over the years, I have honed my skills in mandala art, traditional Indian designs, and personalized illustrations. 
    My work has evolved to include calligraphy and tattoo design concepts, allowing me to explore new ways to express creativity and connect with people through art.
  </p>

  <h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
  <p>
    Nature, culture, emotions, and personal experiences inspire my art. I enjoy observing the world around me and translating feelings and stories into visual designs. 
    My goal is to create art that evokes emotion, sparks creativity, and leaves a lasting impression.
